1)in the code for web scraping, one can edit the source ie: the website from where we take information, as well as the destination.

2)the number guessing game:

The number_guessing_game function initializes a random number between 1 and 100 and allows the player to guess the number within 10 attempts.
If the player's guess is too low, the program prompts the player to guess higher. If the guess is too high, the program prompts the player to guess lower.
If the player guesses the correct number within the given attempts, they win. If they use all their attempts, the game reveals the correct number.
You can run this code in a Python environment to play the number guessing game. Feel free to modify the game or create your own text-based game based on this example!
